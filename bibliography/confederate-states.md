Confederate States of America, Department of State, Montgomery.....18'b

This morning I had a yard sale to organize.
Motor court ashtrays and cub scout trophies,
sticky teddy bears with traces of polio
Here was a gift for Mr. + Mrs., an encyclopedia
that described a dead world part by part
a greek dictaphone that hadn't worked since 1979
a battery operated smokeless ashtray. There was
a cardboard box full of joysticks and momma's
dresser mirror, a portrait that revised itself
every morning until she died.
"I WAS BORN TOO LATE" I heard a man
wearing a black quiet riot visor say.
"all the doctors, even my mother, were fast asleep. I had to crawl out myself.
I've been on the streets ever since, trying to think of a bad ass nickname for myself."
