"O get him out of there! " What if it cost 25c  
to wake up in the morning? A dollar, ten dollars?  
I'd pay it all the way to the poor house. It's not made  
if it's made in Roanoke. Night pulling up in front of  
the house like a bus. It came at me with shears. Her  
sweater had faces, famous faces knitted all over it.  
The porch swing ticked off Central Daylight time.  
"How many hours do you think it'll take me to smoke this  
cigarette? " she said with a smile. The smell of fried  
food came drifting out one of the castle windows.  
"Lets go around back" I said "my brother buried some  
stuff back there. " We ducked down and walked through  
the black bushes. My shoe made a sucking sound in  
the turf. "He can afford anything" I said "he's got  
dogs that blow on trumpets. " "Priests! " she cussed.  
Thunder cracks over Ben Franklin's shop. Who wrapped  
my dreams in a blanket and led them outside to the black  
book in the yard? "Hey what indian tribe occupied  
southern california? They were a lucky bunch of fellers! "  
Sting Bible, More Sea Bible, Knur & Spell. In moments  
downhill, towards sleep in the stillwater shop. Imagining  
places I was almost sure I'd never been & had taken to  
assuming were the memories of my grandfather somehow  
deposited in my mind. They were there and gone, just before  
I could get my bearings, catch any names or find out  
where the hotel was. Just a pile of glass shavings that  
could never be reassembled into the gone order  
of buildings & the shade pouring off of them. "WATER! "
