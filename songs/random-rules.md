In 1984 I was hospitalized for approaching perfection.  
Slowly screwing my way across Europe, they had to make a correction.  
Broken and smokin' where the infrared deer plunge in the digital snake.  
I tell you, they make it so you can't shake hands when they make your hands shake. I know you like to line dance, everything so democratic and cool,  
But baby there's no guidance when random rules. I know that a lot of what I say has been lifted off of men's room walls.  
Maybe I've crossed the wrong rivers and walked down all the wrong halls.  
But nothing can change the fact that we used to share a bed  
and that's why it scared me so when you turned to me and said: "Yeah, you look like someone  
Yeah you look like someone who up and left me low.  
Boy, you look like somene I used to know. " I asked the painter why the roads are colored black.  
He said, "Steve, it's because people leave  
and no highway will bring them back. "  
So if you don't want me I promise not to linger,  
But before I go I gotta ask you dear about the tan line on your ring finger. No one should have two lives,  
now you know my middle names are wrong and right.  
Honey we've got two lives to give tonight.
