I never tried as hard I could.  
I've seen more than I've understood.  
Take my father who came back from the dead,  
"I needed just one more drink," he said.  
He sat there reading books,  
While my mother slowly lost her looks.  
And even though we were poor,  
The sun still shined on our door.

O Lord, please come down from the mountain,  
Some of us are broke and having problems,  
And everybody knows, that I know what's going on  
And if cars could run on teardrops, I'd be long, long gone.

I got a plan to get me out of debt,  
I'm gonna play the Superfecta bet,  
I'm gonna change the pattern of the stars  
I'd like to horsewhip all these vcrs  
Screw the soft rock and the salad bars  
Let's turn our backs on all the movie stars  
Let's raise our voices up and sing:  
"We are not one with everything. "O Lord, please come down from the mountain,  
Some of us are broke and having problems,  
And everybody knows, that I know what's going on  
And if cars could run on teardrops, I'd be long, long gone.  
Long, long gone.  
Long, long gone.
