I take decaf coffee  
Two sugars and one cream  
I don’t see the use in staying up just to watch TVI unplug all the neon  
Turn the ringer off the phone  
Throw my thoughts like tomahawks  
Into this world which I disown

Because the pillow that I dream on  
Is the threshold of a kingdom  
Is the threshold of a world where I’m with you

It’s a dark and snowy secret  
And it has to do with heaven  
And what looks like sleep is really hot pursuit

I hold your picture in my mind  
It makes me warm when I am cold  
Gets me up and it makes me walk  
It makes me question what I’m told

Somewhere in a foggy atlas  
Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea  
First life takes time then time takes life  
Now the next move’s up to me

Because the pillow that I dream on  
Leads to some fantastic glory  
It’s the threshold of a world I can’t ignore

Like time unspoiled from heaven  
Did you find me sleeping in your doorway  
Now I’m here for good  
I won’t leave you anymore.
