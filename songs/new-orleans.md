I'm scared (I swear) of you.  
In the tunnel, in the darkness, the darkest walls of blue,  
there's beasts and there's men and there's something on this earth that comes back again:   
Alpha...delta....gamma... everybody's smoked  
You can't say that my soul has died away (x2)  
There's trouble in the hall and trouble up the stairs and trouble in the trouble  
that's troubling the air.  
Please don't say that my soul has died away. There is a house in New Orleans,  
not the one you've heard about. I'm talking about another house.  
They spoke of gold in the cellar that a Spanish gentleman had left.  
I broke in one hundred years ago with a dagger tucked in my vest.  
Legends of gold I've tried to hold in the grey half-lite of the halway at night  
one....two... three, four, five  
we're trapped inside the song. We're trapped inside the song (x3)  
where the nights are so long.  
There's traps inside us all (x3)  
and the nights are so tall.  
And the night is so tall.  
And the knife is so tall.
