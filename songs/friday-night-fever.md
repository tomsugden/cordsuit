I love the sound of a jukebox playing  
So I sit here, while she's staying home  
Watching Dallas on tv  
I love the taste of whiskey straight,  
The strongest thing she ever takes  
Is a sip from a small glass of chablisI've got that Friday Night Fever  
Sometimes a man just needs a breather  
She knows I love her and I need her  
And I'm no cheater  
I've just got that Friday Night Fever

She wouldn't change me if she could  
I wouldn't change her, she's too good  
Sometimes a man just needs a change of pace  
I've heard all those come on lines  
When I go home at closing time  
I know no one could ever take her placeI've got that Friday Night Fever  
Sometimes a man just needs a breather  
She knows I love her and I need her  
And I'm no cheater  
I've just got that Friday Night Fever
