I saw the river playing in the valley (C, Am, Em)  
Rushing round a bend and skipping stones (C, Am, Em)  
I saw the meadow wobble in the moonlight (C, Am, Em)  
I've come to get my girl and take her home. (C, Am, Em)Her doorbell plays a bar of Stephen Foster (Am, G, C)  
Her sister never left and look what it cost her (Am, G, C)  
We're gonna live in Nashville and I'll make a career (Am, G, C, Am)  
Out of writing sad songs and getting paid by the tear.

Chorus::Marry me, leave Kentucky and come to Tennessee (G, C, G, D):Cause you're the only ten I see, you're the only ten I see. (G, C, D):I've looked through offices and honkytonks for a man man enough to be (G, C, G, D):Mr. and Mrs. Tennessee, Mr. and Mrs. Tennessee (G, C, D)Punk rock died when the first kid said (C, Am, Em)  
"Punk's not dead, punk's not dead" (C, Am, Em)  
You know Louisville is death we've got to up and move (C, Am, Em)  
Because the dead do not improve. (C, Am, Em)Goodbye users and suckers and steady bad luckers (Am, G, C)  
We're off to the land of club soda unbridled (Am, G, C)  
We're off to the land of hot middle-aged women (Am, G, C)  
We're off to the land whose blood runneth orange. (Am, G, C)(chorus)
