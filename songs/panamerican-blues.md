a fifth on decoration day for the doctor  
that fixed my arm. The federales back  
from Tuscon, each one got an arm gone.  
Limehouse Pratt got dim inside, can't see  
the painted ladies runaround at night.  
A wood-paneled room, my cigarette fumes  
waltz and dissolve just for you.  
There's gonna be a truce(x3) but  
first you got to set your horses loose.  
A jaguar simmering in a cage, give him  
a chance, can you tell the answer from the  
ants. History's got it's walking papers  
can't get enough of the make-up  
that makes it look so tough.  
Well it ssssseems just like a freeze out (x3).an undisclosed, deeply wooded  
lose your way route.
