title: Slow Education
layout: song
---

When God was young, he made the wind and the sun
Since then, it's been a slow education
And you got that one idea again
The one about dying.

Chorus: 
Oh oh oh I'm lightning
Oh oh oh I'm rain
Oh oh oh it's frightening
I'm not the same, I'm not the same,
I'm not the same

There's a screen door banging in the wind
Remember you wanted to be like George Washington back then
Everybody's going down on themselves
No pardon me's or fare thee wells in the end

(Chorus)
