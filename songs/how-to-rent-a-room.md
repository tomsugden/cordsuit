No I don't really want to die  
I only want to die in your eyes  
I'm still here below the chandelier  
where they always used to read us our rights

I want to wander through the night  
as a figure in the distance even to my own eye  
Have you ever rented a room  
have you even ever rented a room?

An anchor lets you see the river move  
but now that your evil dreams came true  
there on your face  
a row of teeth he'll come to replace

I know you laughed when I left  
but you really only hurt yourself  
When you see your curtains move in the wind  
you can bet I'm betting against you again Cause

I'm a man who has a wife who has a mother  
who married one but she loved another  
You're a tower without the bells  
you're a negative wishing well

I should have checked the stable door  
for the name of the sire and dam  
you were always at the dogtrack  
with your brother and all his friends

Chalk lines around my body  
like the shoreline of a lake  
Your laughter made me nervous  
it made your body shake too hard

Now there's a lot of things that I'm gonna miss  
like thunder down country and the way water drips  
when you're running for the door in the rain  
read the metro section...see my name

No I didn't really want to die  
I only wanted to die in your eyes  
Grant me one last wish  
Life should mean a lot less than this
