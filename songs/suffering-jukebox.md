while these seconds turn these minutes into hours of the day  
while these doubles drive the dollars and the light of day awaysuffering jukebox such a sad machine  
you're all filled up with (what) other people need  
and they never seem to turn you up loud

you got Tennessee tendencies and chemical dependencies  
you make the same old jokes and malaprops on cuesuffering jukebox such a sad machine  
you're all filled up with (what) other people need
