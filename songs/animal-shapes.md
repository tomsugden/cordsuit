gold and green/red and blue.  
are the lights on the signs that line charlotte avenue.  
from a corner window, I watch the falling white flakes.  
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes.animal shapes, animal shapes,  
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes.we've got no goodwill, no goodwill to give.  
to those who try to take away the things we need to live.  
friend, this is from your friend, offa natchez trace.  
the only dream left worth believing starts with animal shapes.animal shapes, animal shapes,  
nothing better get in the way of whatever it takes.later on, somewhere else, I said some things I didn't mean.  
I know everybody's on a first name basis with the king.  
from a corner window, I watch the falling snowflakes.  
God must be carving the the clouds into animal shapes.animal shapes, animal shapes,  
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes.  
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes.
