Father drove a steamroller  
Momma was a crossing guard.  
She got rolled when he got steamed  
And I got left in charge  
Living in a little town with my pedigree in shards  
I chopped down a weakened willow tree  
And built this party barge

Ports of call, dayglo bait  
Why not see a legend while it's still being made?  
Think it's kind of squirrelly when you're sleeping in the park  
Jam too far propagating in the night  
My colleagues and associates have kicked out all the lights  
Like I said they say, nothing stops a party barge"This is lake directory, calling party barge.  
I'm on the phone with pump control, they say you are at large  
Send us your coordinates, we'll send a Saint Bernard"  
Think it's kind of squirrelly when you're sleeping in the park  
Chicken fried pigeon in a sunny jane sauce  
Satan's jeweled laughter has your wife in its claws  
Like I said they say, nothing stops a party barge"Send us your coordinates, I'll send a Saint Bernard.  
Send us your coordinates, I'll send a Saint Bernard.  
Send us your coordinates, I'll send a Saint Bernard.  
This is lake directory, calling party barge. "
