the river winds round these little green hills,  
and stays in the woods for days.  
we were built to consider the unmanifested,  
and make of love an immaculate place.

I hear a smile and a tear in your voice.  
don't lay the groundwork for a case of remorse.  
when you feel that first ice cold twist in the wind.  
I'll come back by the way that I came.  
shot of dixie hemlock will take care of the pain.now a man keeps his money folded square in his pocket  
and doesn't take everything that he could.  
he'll rise like a lion and line himself up  
with the poor, the fair, and the good.when you feel that first ice cold twist in the wind  
will you hang a lamp at the end of the lane?  
black-eyed susans from the maryland shore.  
we'll trim back the thorns around the hospital door.  
more will be seen than will be understood.  
go with the poor, the fair, and the good.  
go with the poor, the fair, and the good.© D.C.
