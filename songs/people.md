Moments can be monuments to you  
If your life is interesting and true.  
It's just the same for a man or a girl,  
The meaning of the world lies outside the world. People love people and they understand  
if you wanna renovate your background mind  
(a federal woman needs a municipal man)  
people gotta synchronize to animal time. You can't change the feeling  
but you can change your feelings about the feelings in a second or two  
People always come around. I'm studying the ceiling on a little afternoon  
and when I paint my dining room  
people gonna come around. I love to see a rainbow from a garden hose  
lit up like the blood of a centerfold  
I love the city and the city rain,  
suburban kids with biblical names. People ask people to watch their scotch.  
People send people up to the moon.  
When they return, well there isn't much.  
People be careful not to crest too soon. The drums march along at the clip of an I.V. drip  
like sparks from a muffler dragged down the strip.  
I really hope you'll come around. It's sunny and 75. It feels so good to be alive.  
Come on baby don't stay inside.  
Everybody's coming out tonight.
